## Genetic diversity over time
The code to generate Figures 7 and S12.

Genetic diversity was calculated in year time windows for each region using pact. Regional BEAST posterior trees for each gene were renamed as in.trees

Run `pact_formatter.py` in directory containing in.trees
Run `run_pact_batch.sh` to run all regions

Plotted the diversity output using R
`Skyline_generator_pairdiv_genome.R`
