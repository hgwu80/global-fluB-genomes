## Timeline of trunk substutions
The code to generate Figure 5.

Trunk substitutions summaries were generated for each gene using `trees_annotation_parser_cpvals_farm_mcct.py` (see [genotypes-and-substitutions](/genotypes-and-substitutions)) were compiled into one csv file all_fluB.trunk_sub_dates.csv

The Gantt-based summary timeline plots were generated in R:
`trunk_subs_gantt_plotter.R`
